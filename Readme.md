## Basic Cli for Blockchain Using Rust

This project demonstrates a rudimentary blockchain implementation in Rust, providing a basic framework for understanding the core concepts of blockchain technology.

## Key Features
- **Genesis Block Creation:**
    Establishes the foundation of the blockchain with a pre-defined miner address and difficulty level
- **Transaction Processing:**
    Allows users to initiate transactions by specifying a sender, receiver, and amount.
- **Block Mining:**
    Enables generation of new blocks through a user-selectable difficulty level, simulating proof-of-work consensus.
- **Interactive Menu(CLI):**
    Provides a user-friendly interface for transaction creation, block mining, and customization of difficulty and reward parameters
- **Basic Input/Output:**
    Employs standard input/output (io) functionalities for user interaction and data exchange.
